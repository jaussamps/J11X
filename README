     This is a basic analog test rig for J112/3 JFETs, used to determine
     V_GS(off) and I_DSS for specific samples. The design can easily be
     modified to test other N-type depletion-mode families by changing 
     the meters, power rails, etc. to account for their characteristics. 

     As always, this design is free for you to use as you see fit, but
     you do so at your own risk: I provide no warranties of any kind.
