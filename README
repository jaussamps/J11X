     This is a basic analog test rig for J112/3 JFETs, for determining
     V_GS(off) and I_DSS of specific samples. The design can easily be
     modified to test other N-type depletion-mode families by changing
     power rails, etc. as needed to account for their characteristics.

     As always, this design is free for you to use as you see fit, but
     you do so at your own risk: I provide no warranties of any kind.
